## Journey
### Early Life
Lately, I've really started enjoying life after discovering who I am and what I love. Developing and designing systems feels fantastic, and I've made peace with myself by following my love.
 I got into software engineering because I observed how crucial and fast-growing technology is. My sense of purpose and fulfillment in this sector is greatly enhanced by my creations and innovations.

### Education and Career
During my senior year of high school, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many things were done using technology, I became aware of the significance and potential of technology, which led me to pursue a career as a software engineer. I grew up in a family that did not have anyone educated, so I excelled in school and appeared to be the best my family ever had.

### Goals
My main goal is to become highly skilled in my field, to the point where even the best engineers recognize my abilities. I want to use this expertise to develop innovative systems and contribute to the advancement of technology.

## Projects
### Project 1
My first project was a healthcare system for my school's final assessment. It involved designing and developing a system to manage patient records, appointments, and medical histories. This project allowed me to apply my skills to the last atom of my strength.

### Project 2
This project was amazing for me. I developt a website for a friend of mine who is a photographer. This one allowed customers to see pictures this small company captured and also to allow them book appointments.
